This project explores how rays reflect off a convex mirror. The script calculates the fraction of incoming rays that hit a target (an object, or in real scenarios, a PV cell) after reflection. The calculations are validated by:

Mathematically confirming the geometry of reflection.
Graphing the reflections and verifying that the logic matches geometric expectations.
Experimentally sweeping through different angles, mirror radii, and target positions to determine optimal configurations.
