<h1> Reflector Optimization and Solar PV Output Analysis </h1>

<h3> This repository contains scripts and resources to design, optimize, and validate a reflector system for solar PV installations. It also includes methods to calculate the power output of a solar park and compare theoretical results with real-world data. </h3>

<h2> Contents </h2>

<u> 1 - sim </u>

<h3> Explores how rays reflect off a convex mirror and the conditions under which they hit a target (e.g., a PV cell). </h3>

<u> 2 - regression </u>

<h3> Uses linear regression to compare theoretical power output with actual measured data, validating the simulation. </h3>

<u> 3 - production_model </u>

<h3> Calculates optimal solar park parameters (including reflector and PV dimensions) and estimates power output for a default area of 1 hectare. </h3>
